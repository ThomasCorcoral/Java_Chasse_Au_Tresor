## What is this project?

This project called Scavenger Hunt is a program that mixes pathfinding and random. Indeed, 3 pieces (named A B and C) appear on a game board. We can then play the turns one by one. In the end, a player will arrive at the Treasury box and win the game. Once the game is over, a new one can be relaunched. The project is modular. Indeed, you can if you wish via the source code. Add players, walls, increase the size of the field and even create new boxes.
